# Automated Malware Analysis Framework

## Description
This project is a framework that automates the analysis of malware samples, including static and dynamic analysis.

## Skills
- Python
- Reverse Engineering
- Virtualization
- Machine Learning

## Features
- Static analysis (hash calculation, string extraction)
- Dynamic analysis (sandbox execution)
- Machine learning for malware classification

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/Malware-Analysis-Framework.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Malware-Analysis-Framework/src
    ```
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```
4. Run static analysis:
    ```bash
    python static_analysis.py
    ```
5. Run dynamic analysis:
    ```bash
    python dynamic_analysis.py
    ```
6. Train the machine learning model:
    ```bash
    python ml_classification.py
    ```

## Usage
- Place your malware samples in the `data/` directory.
- Run the scripts to perform static and dynamic analysis, and to train the machine learning model.
